# Tawara-Sanctuary-website
This is a Html, Css based website for Tawara Giraffe Sanctuary.<br>
It's my first project on github (also first time making a website not for an exam purpose). <br>
The body of the website is table based inserting images and videos. <br>
Text formatting is applied using fonts from google. <br>
Buttons are provided at the very top and bottom of the page for sending email or linking another web page. <br>
Css stylesheet is used to provide a coloured background and adjust the size of text.<br>
I understand this is a basic website but I will try my best to improve upon my skills as I learn more. <br>
