# Tawara-Sanctuary-website
This is a Html, Css based website for Tawara Giraffe Sanctuary.
It's my first project on github (also first time making a website not for an exam purpose). 
The body of the website is table based inserting images and videos. 
Text formatting is applied using fonts from google. 
Buttons are provided at the very top and bottom of the page for sending email or linking another web page.
Css stylesheet is used to provide a coloured background and adjust the size of text.
I understand this is a basic website but I will try my best to improve upon my skills as I learn more.
